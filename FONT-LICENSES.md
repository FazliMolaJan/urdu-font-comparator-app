  *This was developed way back in 2005 under a government grant. Free for commercial/personal use. No restrictions.* 
  Mohsin has himself mentioned this in a [google group discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/early-access-fonts/ll-d7jq4X_8/GC0EjqVPxj4J) and unfortunately that's the only available public comment from him.
  I tried contacting him but received no response so far.

  This font's copyright notice reads, *Copyright (c) M. G. Abbas Malik, 2006. All rights reserved.* and later I found out that
  <. G. Abbas Malik himself announced about it in this [Yahoo Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/urdu_computing/conversations/topics/1258) on Dec 15, 2006.
  
  The font also contains a license text which was not the SIL Open Font License:
  
  ```

  allowed me to use the font in this project.
