# Urdu Font Comparator 

### What does this project do?

This project is an Android project which allows users to choose different Urdu Fonts and visually see how they effect Urdu text on a mobile screen. 

I wanted to play with Urdu fonts for a while but was still not getting a starting point or a solid motivation to do it. This idea originated since I read the news about a new and much improved font, [Meher Nastaliq](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/urdufont/) launched by [Center for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/) lab at [International Technical University (ITU)](http://itu.edu.pk/), Lahore (Pakistan). The website claims it to be a step towards advanced Urdu Typography and a font which serves the need of modern mobile applications. It was enough to get my attention and wanted to try it out and also see how it is different from others. Then once I started thinking about it, I realized that there is no app or a resource where I can see how different fonts (there are a lot actually!) looks like with Urdu text.  


### Why is this project useful?

This project is useful because it can assist the concerned people in making a better decision on chosing the right Urdu font for their apps. 

Urdu as a language has not been integrated yet with the digital age. We only have handful of websites entirely in Urdu and only a small chunk with the right Nastaliq font style. The choice of font matters a lot because it makes the text more natural to read and fairly easy to understand. I plan to additional valuable information about fonts like licenses, performance metrics etc. 

Additionally, I have also prepared a [Google Doc]() with all the fonts and their respective information.

### How do I get started?

Nothing special, just fork and create a PR with your contributions. Later, I plan to define a certain criteria for those who want to include a new font in the app. 

### Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me (obviously!) at wahib.tech@gmail.com or tweet me at @wahibhaq. I will also try to get in contact with the R&D team behind [Center for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/), [ITU](http://itu.edu.pk/). They can be of great help to us.
